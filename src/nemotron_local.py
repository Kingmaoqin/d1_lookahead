Third backbone: NVIDIA Nemotron-Labs-Diffusion-3B.

WHY THIS BACKBONE EXISTS IN THIS PROJECT
The brief asks for a SECONDARY external-validity label built from task utility
(exact answer / unit-test reward) on verifiable tasks. That check was never
possible on the first two backbones: MDLM-owt and SEDD-small are unconditional
OpenWebText models with no instruction ability, so there is no task to be right
or wrong about. Nemotron-Labs-Diffusion is instruction-tuned AND has a masked
diffusion mode, which makes the check possible for the first time.

Provenance: NVIDIA (US), NVIDIA Open Model License. Non-Chinese-origin, so the
brief's hard model-provenance rule is satisfied -- which matters here because
essentially every other instruction-capable diffusion LLM (LLaDA, Dream) is on
the forbidden list, and the brief's fallback was an AR->DLM LoRA conversion
that this model makes unnecessary.

Measured substrate facts (see results/phase_s_nemotron/):
  * mask_token_id = 100; 26 layers; hidden 3072; vocab 131072
  * a plain forward() runs FULL BIDIRECTIONAL attention -- `modeling_ministral`
    only builds a causal mask when `use_causal_mask=True` is passed, and AR
    mode is what passes it. Verified empirically: changing text AFTER a masked
    position moves that position's prediction by 0.95 in max probability, which
    causal attention could not do.
  * GSM8K in the model's own dLM mode: 16/24 = 66.7% -- a non-degenerate task
    signal, which is the Phase-S gate that MDLM and SEDD could not clear.

TWO IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
1. `output_hidden_states=True` returns None on this checkpoint, so per-layer
   states are captured with forward hooks on the decoder layers instead. The
   hooks are installed once and read from a scratch dict per call.
2. It needs transformers>=5.0.0 (env `p08_skilloverload`), unlike the rest of
   this project (env `llm`, transformers 4.53).
